excellent phone , excellent service .
['excellent']

i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .

Netural

there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
['great', 'right', 'worked']

Positive

just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .

after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
['delighted']
['torture']
Netural

i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
['great', 'perfect', 'superior', 'work']
[]
Positive

i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
['best', 'prefer']
[]
Positive

my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
['favorite']
[]
Positive

the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
['audible']
['noise']
Netural

the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
['blessing']
[]
Positive

the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
['recommend', 'winner']
[]
Positive

good phone , so-so service .
['good']
[]
Positive

the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
[]
[]
Netural

after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
[]
['expensive', 'horrible']
Negative

i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
['decent']
[]
Positive

here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
['cute', 'pretty', 'sturdy']
['break']
Positive

it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
['cute', 'favorite']
[]
Positive

i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
[]
['unpredictable']
Negative

also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
['work']
['tedious']
Netural

the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
['good', 'like']
['hurts']
Positive

the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
['decent']
[]
Positive

the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
['crisp', 'liked']
[]
Positive

however , it serves its purpose .
[]
[]
Netural

the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
[]
['dangerous']
Negative

i checked with nokia .
[]
[]
Netural

the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
[]
[]
Netural

the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
[]
['uncreative']
Negative

more downside to this phone ?
[]
['downside']
Negative

the volume .
[]
[]
Netural

oh my goodness --
['goodness']
[]
Positive

i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
['excellent', 'quiet']
[]
Positive

forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
[]
[]
Netural

on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
['amazing']
[]
Positive

i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
['like']
[]
Positive

i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
[]
[]
Netural

i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
['exceptional']
['horrendous']
Netural

reason ?
[]
[]
Netural

they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
[]
[]
Netural

also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
['works']
['cheap']
Netural

since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .
['promised', 'work']
[]
Positive

i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
['worked']
[]
Positive

24 hours ?
[]
[]
Netural

by what time standards -- martian ?
[]
[]
Netural

apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
[]
['back-logged']
Negative

also , they 'd forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
['capability']
[]
Positive

in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
['fairness', 'nice']
['hard']
Positive

but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a " yes " answer from you .
[]
['annoying']
Negative

i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
['assurance', 'right']
[]
Positive

" when will my t-zones work ? " , csr :
['work']
[]
Positive

" i 'm not sure " . ) .
[]
[]
Netural

umm , well , thanks for nothing .
['well']
[]
Positive

this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
['well']
[]
Positive

that was annoying .
[]
['annoying']
Negative

t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
['good', 'pretty']
['hard']
Positive

however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
['clear']
[]
Positive

and no t-zones .
[]
[]
Netural

so what 's the point ?
[]
[]
Netural

i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
['clarity', 'exceptional', 'good']
['fear']
Positive

i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
['love']
['expensive']
Netural

guess all that glitters is not gold .
['gold']
[]
Positive

it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
['work', 'worth']
['bad']
Positive

hope someone else has better luck !
['better', 'luck']
[]
Positive

the phone refused to die .
[]
['die', 'refused']
Negative

i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
[]
[]
Netural

recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
[]
[]
Netural

disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
['revive']
['disgusted']
Netural

two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
[]
[]
Netural

while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
['like', 'regard']
[]
Positive

i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
['recommend']
[]
Positive

best phone for free .
['best', 'free']
[]
Positive

i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
['best']
[]
Positive

no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
[]
[]
Netural

from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
['clarity', 'nifty']
[]
Positive

whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
['brisk', 'glad']
[]
Positive

wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
[]
[]
Netural

glad to own .
['glad']
[]
Positive

i have had this phone for about 5 months .
[]
[]
Netural

i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
['well']
[]
Positive

at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
[]
[]
Netural

it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
[]
[]
Netural

signal strength will affect the battery life .
[]
[]
Netural

frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
[]
[]
Netural

i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
['great']
['scratched']
Netural

i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
[]
['scratch', 'unbearable']
Negative

the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
['good']
[]
Positive

some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
['easy']
[]
Positive

the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
[]
['hard']
Negative

the vibration is not top .
['top']
['vibration']
Netural

it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
[]
['hard']
Negative

i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
['easier']
['vibrate', 'vibration']
Negative

vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
[]
['vibration']
Negative

so it was no loss .
[]
['loss']
Negative

overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
['favorite']
[]
Positive

great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
['great', 'like', 'perfect', 'quieter']
[]
Positive

i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
[]
[]
Netural

i am bored with the silver look .
[]
['bored']
Negative

cool .
['cool']
[]
Positive

it has a nice color screen .
['nice']
[]
Positive

it is small .
[]
[]
Netural

radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
['awsome', 'work']
[]
Positive

that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
[]
['bad']
Negative

t-mobile was a pretty good server .
['good', 'pretty']
[]
Positive

it has 2 games .
[]
[]
Netural

they are not wowable good .
['good']
[]
Positive

you have to buy better ones .
['better']
[]
Positive

it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
[]
[]
Netural

great phone , but no warranty !
['great']
[]
Positive

this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
['nice']
[]
Positive

nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
[]
[]
Netural

we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
['easy']
['broken', 'died']
Negative

i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
[]
[]
Netural

menu flaws ? mine could n't send text messages .
[]
['flaws']
Negative

i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
['upgraded']
[]
Positive

when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
[]
[]
Netural

it defaulted to unchangeable email .
[]
[]
Netural

so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
['support']
['problem']
Netural

i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
['work']
[]
Positive

he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
['support']
[]
Positive

so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
[]
['lost']
Negative

while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
['excellent', 'good', 'positive']
[]
Positive

negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
[]
['difficult', 'impossibly', 'negative']
Negative

poor visibility on the keys .

you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .

great speakerphone and great reception ! ! reccomend !
['great']
[]
Positive

the title says it all ...
[]
[]
Netural

the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
['excellent', 'superb']
[]
Positive

only con i can think of is no camera ... .
[]
[]
Netural

no big deal for the size . .
[]

Netural

this phone is a winner ...

perfect .

[]
Positive

the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
['perfectly', 'work']
[]
Positive

the speakerphone :
[]
[]
Netural

this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
['cool', 'useful']
[]
Positive

as said before this works perfectly .
['perfectly', 'works']
[]
Positive

you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
[]
['disturbance']
Negative

the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
['perfectly']
[]
Positive

you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
['perfectly', 'work']
[]
Positive

only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
[]
['complaint']
Negative

the radio :
[]
[]
Netural

this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
[]
[]
Netural

this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
['clearly', 'decent', 'fairly', 'good', 'perfectly', 'work']
[]
Positive

tri-band :
[]
[]
Netural

one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
['beneficial']
[]
Positive

i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
['perfectly', 'worked']
[]
Positive

the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
[]
['glitch', 'problem']
Negative

anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
[]
[]
Netural

if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
['like', 'work', 'worked']
[]
Positive

sold in other parts of the world :
[]
[]
Netural

another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
['benefit']
[]
Positive

this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
['good', 'like']
['break']
Positive

or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
[]
[]
Netural

i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
['benefit', 'enough']
['stress']
Positive

able to use service in another country :
[]
[]
Netural

if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
[]
[]
Netural

you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
[]
[]
Netural

size and weight :
[]
[]
Netural

when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
[]
['unbelievably']
Negative

this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
['benefit']
[]
Positive

battery life :
[]
[]
Netural

the battery life on this phone is surreal .
['surreal']
[]
Positive

it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
[]
[]
Netural

i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
[]
[]
Netural

it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
['amazing']
[]
Positive

this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
['beneficial']
[]
Positive

the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
[]
['lacks', 'problems']
Negative

overall , i highly recommend this phone .

it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .

speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
['clear', 'like', 'nice']

surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
['available', 'nice', 'well']

cons :

['cons']
Negative

ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
[]
['annoying', 'crazy']
Negative

the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
[]
['scratched']

games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .

after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
['sexy']
['broken']
Netural

i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
[]
[]
Netural

although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
['outstanding']

the reception and sound quality are top-notch .

i like the size and weight of this little critter .
['like']
[]
Positive

i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
[]
[]
Netural

the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
[]
['funky', 'weird']
Negative

the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
[]
['confusing']
Negative

but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
[]
['obstacle']
Negative

the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
['bright', 'easy', 'nice']
[]
Positive

it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
['nice']
[]
Positive

there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
[]
[]
Netural

the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
[]
[]
Netural

thumbs down on that one .
[]
[]
Netural

the vibrate setting is loud !
[]
['loud', 'vibrate']
Negative

so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
['silent', 'well', 'work']
['loud', 'terribly']
Positive

but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
[]
['loud']
Negative

which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
['good']
[]
Positive

other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .

cons :

not many .

[]
Netural

the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .

pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
[]
['expensive']
Negative

please !

is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
['free', 'subsidizes']

slightly better than average phone in its class .
['better']

first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
['right']
[]
Positive

my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
['cheaper', 'superior']
[]

below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :

Netural

sound quality :
[]
[]
Netural

the most important thing for me is sound quality .
['important']
[]
Positive

nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
['good']
[]
Positive

i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
['better']
[]
Positive

the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
['great', 'right']
['loud']
Positive

overall design :
[]
[]
Netural

i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
['like']
[]
Positive

of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
[]
[]
Netural

the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
[]
[]
Netural

as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
['better', 'like']
['scratch']
Positive

ease of use :
['ease']
[]
Positive

how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
['easy']
[]
Positive

the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
['like']
['alarm']
Netural

that is a very nice feature .
['nice']
[]
Positive

the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
['easier']
[]
Positive

the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
[]
[]
Netural

battery :
[]
[]
Netural

the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
[]
[]
Netural

the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
[]
['horrible']
Negative

features :
[]
[]
Netural

the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
[]
[]
Netural

personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
['integrated', 'nice']
[]
Positive

my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
[]
['paranoid']
Negative

the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
[]
[]
Netural

the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
[]
['useless', 'utterly']
Negative

it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
['useful']
['useless']
Netural

the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
['beautiful']
[]
Positive

all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
['ready']
[]
Positive

in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
['best']

regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
['support', 'work']

i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .

oh well ..
['well']
[]

overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
['better']
[]

both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
[]
[]
Netural

personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
['better', 'like', 'liking']
[]

i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
['good']
[]
Positive

if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
[]
[]
Netural

they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
['free']

here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .

you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .

the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .

this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .

prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .

to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .

it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .

this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
[]

on an average , you would charge it once a week .

Netural

the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
['like', 'powerful']

i simply love this feature .

in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .

the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .

if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .

the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .

no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
[]

Netural

just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .

additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )

the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .

if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .

if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .

although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .

the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .

however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .

in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
[]
['issue', 'worst']

it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .

one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .

that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .

it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .

what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .

so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .

it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .

for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .

Netural

the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
['better']
[]
Positive

one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
[]
[]
Netural

every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
[]
[]
Netural

anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
[]
[]
Netural

tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .

that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !

using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .

yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .

the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
['good', 'great']
[]
Positive

the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
['bright', 'responsive', 'shine']

my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
[]
['gripe']
Negative

nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
[]
['unnecessary']
Negative

this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .

( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
['fair']
[]
Positive

other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
['patience', 'perfect']

Positive

finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
[]
['thumbs-down']
Negative

their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
[]
['overloaded', 'sporadic', 'unpleasant']
Negative

if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .

great phone , great service , no voice dialing .

the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
['great']
[]
Positive

when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
[]
[]
Netural

after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
['perfect']
[]
Positive

it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
['comfortable']
[]
Positive

the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
[]
['mess']
Negative

unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .

when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
['good']
[]
Positive

the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
['bright', 'good']
[]
Positive

the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
[]
[]
Netural

i like the default blue .
['like']
[]
Positive

you can also set a background wallpaper .

Netural

the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
['awesome']
[]
Positive

no more annoying series of beeps .
[]
['annoying']
Negative

this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
['like']
[]
Positive

you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
[]
[]
Netural

the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
['work']
[]
Positive

the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
['cool']
['alarm']
Netural

the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
['useful']
['pain', 'slow']
Negative

you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
[]
[]
Netural

the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
[]

one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
['support']
['downside']
Netural

their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
['compatible', 'supported']
['error']

i have been assured this will be fixed soon .

now , for the t-mobile service :
[]
[]
Netural

i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
['enough', 'good']
[]
Positive

if you have a question , they have the answer .
[]
[]
Netural

and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
['pretty']
[]
Positive

every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
['cheerful']
[]
Positive

all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
['satisfactorily']
['problems']
Netural

i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !
['like']
[]
Positive

the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
['good']
[]
Positive

different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
['well']
[]
Positive

the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
['worked']
[]
Positive

this phone is highly recommended otherwise .

t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone .
['good']

nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
['clear', 'great']
[]
Positive

with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
['accessible', 'great']
['complicated']
Positive

the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
[]
['disappointment', 'lack']
Negative

one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a " worldphone " and can be used in europe , etc.
[]
[]
Netural

yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
[]
[]
Netural

the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
['work']
[]
Positive

therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
[]
[]
Netural

after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
[]
[]
Netural

bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
[]
[]
Netural

find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
[]
[]
Netural

a good phone .

this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .

however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .

it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .

when talking the voice is not very clear .
